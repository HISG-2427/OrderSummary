## My process

I first started with the readily avaialable html markup and then started giving div classes and span classes and all the other classes to different texts. Then I started with the css editing which took me a while, but I tried to do it similar to a clone!!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The thing I am proud of in my coding the most and also the thing which I got to learn from this project a lot is the content spacing and alignment. Took me a while to get all the contents to their respective areas:)
